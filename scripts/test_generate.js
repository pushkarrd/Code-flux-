// Backend Removed — test script deprecated
// The project is strictly frontend-only. This script used to POST to
// `http://localhost:4000/generate-course` for local testing but that endpoint
// is no longer available. The file is intentionally inert to avoid accidental
// requests and to keep the repo frontend-only.

console.log('scripts/test_generate.js: project is frontend-only — no-op')
